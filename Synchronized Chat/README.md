# Synchronized Chat
Tutorial project showing a minimal multiplayer "chat" in Godot, using Godot's MultiplayerSpawner and MultiplayerSynchronizer.

## Scene replication: RPC vs. MultiplayerSpawner vs. MultiplayerSynchronizer
In this tutorial we will be looking at scene replication using the [MultiplayerSpawner](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayerspawner.html) and [MultiplayerSynchronizer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayersynchronizer.html) (Synchronizer/Spawner for short). We will look at RPCs in the [RPC Chat](https://github.com/jkvastad/Godot-4-Multiplayer-Tutorials/tree/main/RPC%20Chat) tutorial.

While no official multiplayer tutorial is part of the docs yet (analogous to "[Your first 2D Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)" and "[Your first 3D Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html)"), the intended workflow seems to be:

1. Network peers place RPC calls to ask the server for game state changes.
2. The server creates/deletes scenes locally, which are replicated across the network using spawners.
3. The newly spawned scenes/nodes are synced using synchronizers embedded in the scenes.

### MultiplayerSpawner
MultiplayerSpawner is useful for adding and removing nodes at a server or client and have them replicated to other peers.

The way this works is that every [node](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html) in the [scene tree](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/scene_tree.html) can be described by a [NodePath](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_nodepath.html). 

When we call [add_child](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html#class-node-method-add-child) a node is added and a correspanding path is created. For example in this tutorial when the "multiplayer_chat" scene is added the new node "MultiplayerChat" is inserted into the scene tree at node path "/root/Control/Chats/MultiplayerChat". The MultiplayerSpawner then checks its Auto Spawn list for allowed scenes, and if the added scene matches, it sends out a request to its counterparts on the network, asking:
> "hey, peer with ID x added node /root/Control/Chats/MultiplayerChat, you should too!".

A few problems may arise at this point:

* The scene is not in the receiving spawners Auto Spawn list.
* There is already a node at the desired position. Make sure only one peer can add replicated nodes!
* The desired path does not exist, e.g. Control or Chats may not be in the scene tree, or their order is something other than the specified path. **This is why add_child(Node, true) is important!**
* Someone called add_child who is not the authority of the MultiplayerSpawner node.
  * [Nodes have multiplayer authority](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html#class-node-method-set-multiplayer-authority), a peer ID used for various networking features. One of these features is that only requests coming from the multiplayer authority of the MultiplayerSpawner will actually spawn nodes.
  * By default all authority is 1, the default host ID. Try setting the spawner ID in the tutorial to different values and observe the error messages as peers host/join.

#### Scene tree as visualized in the editor:
Here is an example scene tree as seen in the editor, the SubmitButton node has path "/root/Panel/SubmitButton".

### MultiplayerSynchronizer

While the spawner can add scenes, the scenes are created from scratch with a blank slate. Why not just send the instantiated scene over IP? [You could but you shouldn't](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_scenemultiplayer.html#class-scenemultiplayer-property-allow-object-decoding) - if you allow sending arbitrary objects, they can contain arbitrary code, leaving an opening for [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution) - a serious network security threat. Besides, we still need to update all the relevant values of our networked objects as they change. This is where MultiplayerSynchronizer comes in. 

Because of RCE, synchronization is not supported for Object type properties, like Resource. Properties that are unique to each peer, like the instance IDs of Objects (see Object.get_instance_id) or RIDs, will also not work in synchronization.

So what CAN be synchronized? Built-in types. Numerical values such as transform positions, hit points, basic stats. String values representing various text content. More formally, [all the Variant types except Object](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_variant.html#variant-compatible-types).

To synchronize a property, add it to the property window which is visible when the synchronizer is selected in the editor:

![MultiplayerSynchronizerPropertyWindow](https://github.com/jkvastad/Godot-4-Multiplayer-Tutorials/assets/9295196/f7f07970-bb93-4e31-b5dc-a9b2e7fabc65)

Properties will be synchronized if a matching node path exists in the connected peers' scene trees.

The synchronizer pushes selected properties from the multiplayer authority of the synchronizer.

Note how in the project the authority of the box itself does not matter - only the synchronizer authority ID matters. (Note also that when changing synchronizer ID there is a large variable delay ranging from a few seconds to above one minute before synchronization starts. This might be fixed in later version of Godot.)
